# Predicting hospital readmission of Diabetic Patients

## üìÇ Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Size:** 101766 rows
- **Features:** 50 columns related to patient demographics, lab results, medications, and prior hospital visits.
- **Target Variable:** readmission status (readmitted within 30 days, after 30 days, or not readmitted)

  
## Introduction:
This project aims to predict the likelihood of hospital readmission for diabetic patients based on various clinical and demographic factors. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze patient data to assist healthcare professionals in reducing unnecessary hospitalizations and improving patient care.

## Objective:
To build an efficient model that predicts the likelihood of diabetic patients being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days, after 30 days or not.

## Steps done:
  
  - `Data Collection`
  - `Data Preprocessing - Data Cleaning`
  - `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`
  - `Feature Engineering`
  - `Feature Selection`
  - `Split Data into Training and Testing Sets`
  - `Feature Scaling`
  - `Build the ML Model`
  - `Model Evaluation`
  - `Hyperparameter Tuning and  pipeline`
  - `Save the Model`
  - `Test with Unseen Data`
  - `Interpretation of Results`


## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning Models:** Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis and model development

## Model Performance
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimization

## Results & Insights
- Identified key factors influencing patient readmission
- Provided actionable insights for reducing readmission rates
